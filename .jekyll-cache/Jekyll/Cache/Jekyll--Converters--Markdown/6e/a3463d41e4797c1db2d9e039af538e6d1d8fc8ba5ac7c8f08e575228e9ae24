<h3 id="what-is-python">What is Python?</h3>

<p>Python is an interpreted high level programming language.  It is often classified as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">‚Äúscripting language‚Äù</a> and
is considered similar to languages such as Perl, Tcl, or Ruby.  The syntax
of Python is loosely inspired by elements of C programming.</p>

<p>Python was created by Guido van Rossum around 1990 who named it in honor of Monty Python.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-get-python">Where to get Python?</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python.org</a> is where you obtain Python.  For the purposes of this course, you
only need a basic installation.  I recommend installing Python 3.6 or newer. Python 3.6 is used in the notes
and solutions.</p>

<h3 id="why-was-python-created">Why was Python created?</h3>

<p>In the words of Python‚Äôs creator:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My original motivation for creating Python was the perceived need
for a higher level language in the Amoeba [Operating Systems]
project. I realized that the development of system administration
utilities in C was taking too long. Moreover, doing these things in
the Bourne shell wouldn‚Äôt work for a variety of reasons. ‚Ä¶ So,
there was a need for a language that would bridge the gap between C
and the shell.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Guido van Rossum</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="where-is-python-on-my-machine">Where is Python on my Machine?</h3>

<p>Although there are many environments in which you might run Python,
Python is typically installed on your machine as a program that runs
from the terminal or command shell. From the terminal, you should be
able to type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code> like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bash $ python
Python 3.8.1 (default, Feb 20 2020, 09:29:22)
[Clang 10.0.0 (clang-1000.10.44.4)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("hello world")
hello world
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are new to using the shell or a terminal, you should probably
stop, finish a short tutorial on that first, and then return here.</p>

<p>Although there are many non-shell environments where you can code
Python, you will be a stronger Python programmer if you are able to
run, debug, and interact with Python at the terminal.  This is
Python‚Äôs native environment.  If you are able to use Python here, you
will be able to use it everywhere else.</p>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>

<h3 id="exercise-11-using-python-as-a-calculator">Exercise 1.1: Using Python as a Calculator</h3>

<p>On your machine, start Python and use it as a calulator to solve the
following problem.</p>

<p>Lucky Larry bought 75 shares of Google stock at a price of $235.14 per
share. Today, shares of Google are priced at $711.25. Using Python‚Äôs
interactive mode as a calculator, figure out how much profit Larry would
make if he sold all of his shares.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">711.25</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mf">235.14</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">75</span>
<span class="mf">35708.25</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pro-tip: Use the underscore (_) variable to use the result of the last
calculation. For example, how much profit does Larry make after his evil
broker takes their 20% cut?</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mf">0.80</span>
<span class="mf">28566.600000000002</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="exercise-12-getting-help">Exercise 1.2: Getting help</h3>

<p>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help()</code> command to get help on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">abs()</code> function. Then use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help()</code> to get help on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">round()</code> function. Type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help()</code> just by
itself with no value to enter the interactive help viewer.</p>

<p>One caution with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help()</code> is that it doesn‚Äôt work for basic Python
statements such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">while</code>, and so forth (i.e., if you type
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help(for)</code> you‚Äôll get a syntax error). You can try putting the help
topic in quotes such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help("for")</code> instead. If that doesn‚Äôt work,
you‚Äôll have to turn to an internet search.</p>

<p>Followup: Go to <a href="http://docs.python.org">http://docs.python.org</a> and find the documentation for
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">abs()</code> function (hint: it‚Äôs found under the library reference
related to built-in functions).</p>

<h3 id="exercise-13-cutting-and-pasting">Exercise 1.3: Cutting and Pasting</h3>

<p>This course is structured as a series of traditional web pages where
you are encouraged to try interactive Python code samples <strong>by typing
them out by hand.</strong> If you are learning Python for the first time,
this ‚Äúslow approach‚Äù is encouraged.  You will get a better feel for
the language by slowing down, typing things in, and thinking about
what you are doing.</p>

<p>If you must ‚Äúcut and paste‚Äù code samples, select code
starting after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt and going up to, but not any further
than the first blank line or the next <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt (whichever appears
first). Select ‚Äúcopy‚Äù from the browser, go to the Python window, and
select ‚Äúpaste‚Äù to copy it into the Python shell. To get the code to
run, you may have to hit ‚ÄúReturn‚Äù once after you‚Äôve pasted it in.</p>

<p>Use cut-and-paste to execute the Python statements in this session:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">12</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">20</span>
<span class="mi">32</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
         <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="mi">18</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Warning: It is never possible to paste more than one Python command
(statements that appear after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>) to the basic Python shell at a
time. You have to paste each command one at a time.</p>

<p>Now that you‚Äôve done this, just remember that you will get more out of
the class by typing in code slowly and thinking about it‚Äìnot cut and pasting.</p>

<h3 id="exercise-14-where-is-my-bus">Exercise 1.4: Where is My Bus?</h3>

<p>Try something more advanced and type these statements to find out how
long people waiting on the corner of Clark street and Balmoral in
Chicago will have to wait for the next northbound CTA #22 bus:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">urllib.request</span>

<p>Yes, you just downloaded a web page, parsed an XML document, and
extracted some useful information in about 6 lines of code. The data
you accessed is actually feeding the website
<a href="http://ctabustracker.com/bustime/home.jsp">http://ctabustracker.com/bustime/home.jsp</a>. Try it again and watch
the predictions change.</p>

<p>Note: This service only reports arrival times within the next 30 minutes.
If you‚Äôre in a different timezone and it happens to be 3am in Chicago, you
might not get any output.  You use the tracker link above to double check.</p>

<p>If the first import statement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import urllib.request</code> fails, you‚Äôre
probably using Python 2. For this course, you need to make sure you‚Äôre
using Python 3.6 or newer. Go to <a href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a> to download
it if you need it.</p>

<p>If your work environment requires the use of an HTTP proxy server, you may need
to set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTP_PROXY</code> environment variable to make this part of the
exercise work. For example:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'HTTP_PROXY'</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'http://yourproxy.server.com'</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you can‚Äôt make this work, don‚Äôt worry about it.  The rest of this course
has nothing to do with parsing XML.</p>
